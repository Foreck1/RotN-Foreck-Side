# RotN-Foreck-Side
minecraft folder contains the final product
Assets on their own contains all the files for the resourcepack
Unused sprites contains file that won't be used or are yet to be decided where to use on


# Important:

**1.** Move the folders "config", "resources" and "scripts" to your modded .minecraft instance. Override EVERYTHING it asks for
**2.** CHANGELOG.txt is not up to date
**3.** Mods not included that I've been using for testing purposes:
	*Efortlesbuilding 2.16
	*Farlanders 1.0.1
	*BlockDropsTweaker-1.12.2-2.4
	*malisiscore-1.12.2-6.5.1
	*malisisdoors-1.12.2-7.3.0 (There's a crafting script for this mod bundled with the rest already)
**4.** Some supposedly removed recipes aren't. Need to fix
